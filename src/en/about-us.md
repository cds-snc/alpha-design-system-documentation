# About GC Design System

GC Design System offers basic building blocks and a pattern language to help you design and build a trusted, unified experience for the people using your services. Components and design tokens provide standard Government of Canada branding and experiences for any framework you're using.

We're prioritizing common components and patterns that most GC teams can use. ​​Right now, we're testing GC Design System in alpha, the first usable phase of a product. Use it as a starting point for a website or application and help us improve the design system for public servants.

The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) builds and maintains GC Design System in consultation with the Canada.ca design system team.

## How we're working with Canada.ca design system

GC Design System is incorporating the mandatory elements of Canada.ca. We're working together with the Digital Transformation Office at the Canadian Digital Service to evaluate the design system and add to the roadmap. They continue to provide guidance and support to web and digital practitioners in the GC.
