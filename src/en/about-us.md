# About GC Design System

## Why GC Design System is right for you

GC Design System offers basic building blocks and a common pattern language for frontline digital services. Components and tokens provide standard Government of Canada branding and experiences for any framework you’re using.  

Use GC Design System to meet Government of Canada requirements for digital service delivery and communication:

- Ship recognizable, predictable, and accessible products.
- Build and design a trusted, unified experience for the people using your services.

### Simplify your digital delivery

At the Canadian Digital Service, we’re here to support modern service delivery. GC Design System helps you ship faster by:

- <strong>Reducing manual, repetitive work</strong> with reusable <gcds-link href="{{ links.components }}">components</gcds-link> and <gcds-link href="{{ links.styles }}">styles</gcds-link>, as well as Figma assets for rapid prototyping.
- <strong>Defaulting to federal standards</strong> and accessibility best practice.
- <strong>Uniting code, design, and guidance</strong>, so you have all the basics for creating usable, inclusive experiences.

### Work in the framework you want to work in

With our components and styles, you get:

- <strong>The same result</strong> in any framework or environment you’re using.
- <strong>Minimal coding</strong> and redefining of values: spacing, typography and colour tokens reduce manual updates.
- <strong>An accessible starting point</strong>: We’ve built in accessibility from the start and offer tips for the implementation decisions you’ll make.

### Help create seamless GC service experiences

GC Design System supports a seamless service experience with:

- <strong>Predictable interaction elements</strong> designed to support task success.
- <strong>Inclusive design</strong> for bilingual, equitable digital service delivery.
- <strong>Accessibility guidance</strong> for cognitive and physical considerations: from coding to clear requests and communicating errors.
