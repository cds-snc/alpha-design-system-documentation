# Page templates

Page templates are pre-built pages that combine GC Design System components for common presentations. They’re fully responsive for multi-device use. Their page structures support a predictable, recognizable, and accessible user experience.

## Start your project with pre-built pages

Page templates can be a starting point for you to use GC Design System to prototype or code. Already familiar? They’ll help you create pages faster and then add components to meet user needs.

Unless specified, use them for Canada.ca pages as well as other GC websites.

## Browse templates

We're sharing page templates as we build them.

{% docLinks locale, stage, figma, github %}
{% enddocLinks %}

{% include "partials/template-list.njk" %}

## Coming soon
We're working on the following page templates that will soon be ready for you to try.

- **Topic page**: A page that presents a series of options for popular tasks and services on an important topic.
- **Ministerial profile page**: For landing pages with biographical details and roles and responsibilities of ministers, parliamentary secretaries, and heads of quasi-judicial organizations.
