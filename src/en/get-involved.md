# Get involved

A design system is never complete. We're committed to building with the people who use our products.

Right now, we're testing GC Design System in alpha, the first usable phase of a product. We're iterating based on your needs and those of the people you serve.

## Find out what we're up to

We're sharing what we're working on and what we'll work on next. To get updates on GC Design System, sign up for our mailing list through our [Contact form]({{ links.contact }}).
