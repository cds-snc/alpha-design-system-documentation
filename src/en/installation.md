# Install GC Design System

Get to know a bit about GC Design System, install it, and try it out.

## Bring the GC brand to your Canadian Digital Service product

GC Design System offers basic building blocks for transactional products and a common pattern language for product teams at the Canadian Digital Service and our partners.

Our components are developed with tokens designed to the Canada.ca standard to help you ship recognizable, predictable, and accessible products.

Changes to GC Design System (GCDS) come in a single version update with tokens, components, and non-breaking changes to existing ones. GC Design System is independent of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) and GCWeb.

Install GC Design System and try it out!
