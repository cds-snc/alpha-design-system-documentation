## Stepper anatomy

**The current step** indicates the current step in the process.

**The total steps** indicates the number of steps overall in the process.

**The page H1**, or page title, is a call to action and states the goal of that particular step.

## Accessibility and design for steppers

### Place the stepper above the page heading

Place the stepper over the main heading of the page, under the header and navigational elements.

### Assign a goal to each step in your sequence

- Use a call to action in the page header to convey the goal of each step.
- Make the actions in each step support the stated goal.

Tip: At the end of a process, let a person know what happens next or what they can expect.
