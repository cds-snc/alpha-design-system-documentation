## Stepper anatomy â€“ with H1 title

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>current step</strong> indicates the step the person's on in the process.</li>
  <li>The <strong>total steps</strong> indicates the number of steps overall in the process.</li>
  <li>The <strong>H1 title</strong> is a separate element from the stepper component. It's phrased as a call to action and states the goal of that particular step.</li>
</ol>

## Design and accessibility for steppers

### Place the stepper before the page heading

Place the stepper ahead of  the main heading of the page, after the page header and navigational elements.

### Assign a goal to each step in your sequence

- Phrase the page header as a call to action to convey the goal of each step.
- Make the actions in each step support the stated goal.

Tip: At the end of a process, let a person know what happens next or what they can expect.
