## Design and accessibility for steppers

### Always include the step title after the stepper

The step title and the stepper are a heading on the page. This is a H1, H2, or H3, depending on the [heading hierarchy](https://design-system.alpha.canada.ca/en/components/heading/design/#order-heading-levels-hierarchically) of the page.

### Assign a goal to each step in your sequence

- Choose a step title that reflects the goal of each step.
- Make sure the actions in each step support the stated goal.
