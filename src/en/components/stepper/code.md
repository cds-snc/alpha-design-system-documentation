## Build a stepper

Use a stepper as a guide when a sequence (form or process) can be divided into logical steps and will span three or more pages.

## Accessibility and coding for steppers

### Use each step for a goal

Use the current step to indicate the step that the user is on and the total steps to indicate the overall number of steps.
