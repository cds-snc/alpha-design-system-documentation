## Build a stepper

Use a stepper as a guide when a sequence (form or process) can be divided into logical steps and will span three or more pages.

## Accessibility and coding for steppers

### Use each step for a goal


Use the current step to indicate the step that the user is on and the total steps to indicate the overall number of steps.

## Get your code

Generate code for a component instance by choosing properties in the values column, based on the code elements in the properties table.

Select "Get code" once you have the properties you need. That will generate code for the instance you're building.

Pull that code into your environment and you'll have a component with all the code values you chose.
