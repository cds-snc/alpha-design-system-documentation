Take a look at what problems steppers solve to see if they fit the problem you’re solving for.

## Problems steppers solve

Use a stepper for a logical sequence split over three or more pages to:

- Show a person which step they’re on in a process, like in a multi-step form.
- Make the structure of a path clear by showing the total number of steps.
- Providing a landmark so a person can get situated and track their progress.

<article class="bg-full-width bg-dark text-light pt-500 pb-400 my-500">
  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-400">Related components</h2>

  <a href="{{ links.pagination }}" class="link-light">Pagination</a> when a user needs to navigate a range of pages that are not part of a multi-step process. It provides controls to select the next or previous page.
