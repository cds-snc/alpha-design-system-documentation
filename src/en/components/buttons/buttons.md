# Buttons

A button is an interactive object that highlights an important or common action for the person using your product.

## How a button works

A short label or icon says what the button does. A person communicates using the button when they launch the button’s click action. A click action can be a mouse key, a keydown action, a tap, or a mouse click. 
When someone activates a button, it sets off a response or a change of location or state.

## Button uses

Use a button as a clear, simple means to set off an action. Buttons express agreement or disagreement,  change  location or state, and give direction about information. 
Some common uses are: 
- saving, deleting, downloading. 
- clearing entered data. 
- sending a form or request.
- giving consent or agreement. 
- making a binary choice.
- entering or exiting a web product, like a secure area login, a form, or tutorial.
- skip-to-content link.

In applications, buttons are used in place of text links for things like:   
- controlling movement, like going from one screen to another in a flow.
- external links (in a ways that lets someone know they’re external).

## Related components

Consider links instead when: 
- an action is less important.  
- taking someone off a web page.

Consider menus or selections, like dropdowns or radio buttons, instead for: 
- a choice with more than two options.

## Understanding the basic button component

### Button task

You’ll select a button task based on what you need your button to do. Each task has a different function. They’re styled to help a person using your product predict where to find an action. 

A primary button is a type of button task.  

### Button states

Each task has corrresponding states. A button’s state changes as a person interacts with it. States signal how a button can be used and how someone has used it, like if it’s been selected already.

## How is the button component accessible

Colours, spacing, and typography are built into the button to be accessible.
- Underlining shows a button can be tapped, clicked, or activated.
- Margins and padding size makes sure the tap surface is accessible.
- The button’s size and whitespace are set so tap targets are large enough to hit.
- Font height and weight support responsive design, accessibility, and bilingual content design.
- Button and font colours make button tasks recognizable and with enough contrast.
