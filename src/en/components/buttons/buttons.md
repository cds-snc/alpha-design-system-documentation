# Button Component

A button is an object to activate a response or a change of location or state. 

## Function 

Buttons highlight important actions that help a user achieve tasks.
A button is initialized through a click or keydown action, such applying the Enter key when the buttonâ€™s selected. The user communicates a response, changes their location, or changes their state by using the click or keydown action. 

## What buttons are for

Use buttons for important actions, such as:
- saving, deleting, downloading 
- clearing entered data 
- submitting a form or request
- giving consent or agreement
- making a binary choice
- entering or exiting a web product, like a secure area login, a form, or tutorial

In applications, buttons are used in place of text links for things like:   
- controlling movement, going from one screen to another on a website
- external links  

## What buttons are not for

Consider links instead when:
- taking a user off a website page.
- an action is less important.

Consider menus or selections, like dropdowns or radio buttons, instead when:
- The user must choose between two or more options.
