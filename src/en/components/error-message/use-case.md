Take a look at what problems error messages solve to see if they fit the problem youâ€™re solving for.

## Problems error messages solve

All GC Design System components come with default error handling for required form components.

Use an error message for your own component instances when you need to interrupt a flow because of a problem where:

- A person needs to fix something before they can either continue an action or move on to the next task.
- A form component is required.
- You need to specify an incorrect response type or format and let a person know exactly what to do to fix the problem and move on.

<a href="{{ links.errorSummary }}" class="link-light">Error summary</a> for listing all problems to address for response submission.

Alert for communicating an important or time-sensitive change.
