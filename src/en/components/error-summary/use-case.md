Take a look at what problems error summaries solve to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

GC Design System form components come with default error handling. When a person tries to submit a form, any errors to required components will prompt an error summary.

## Problems that error summaries solve

Use an error summary to interrupt a person who's submitting a form when there is a problem or a series of problems to:

- Make errors obvious so a person knows about them and how to address them.
- List <a href="{{ links.errorMessage }}">error messages</a> when a person needs to add information or make a correction to two or more components before they can submit a form.

<article class="bg-full-width bg-primary text-light pt-500 pb-400 my-500">
  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-400">Related components</h2>

<a href="{{ links.errorMessage }}" class="link-light">Error message</a> for describing a problem blocking a user action, related to a single component.
