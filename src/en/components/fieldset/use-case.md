Take a look at what problems fieldsets solve to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems fieldsets solve

Use a fieldset to group together related form elements or components so they're perceivable when:

- A set of options corresponds to the same question, like with radios or checkboxes.
- Several questions in a flow relate to the same topic, like a set of inputs or other combination of form components.
- Logically grouping form elements or components helps support understanding and usability.

  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-400">Related components</h2>

  <a href="/en/components/input" class="link-light">Inputs</a> or <a href="/en/components/textarea" class="link-light">text areas</a> when you are requesting a written response from a person.

  Pagination when you are spreading form elements across multiple pages.
