## Build a file uploader

Use the file uploader to allow a person to select and review files theyâ€™d like to include with their submission.

## Code and accessibility for file uploader

### Apply required attributes

For the file uploader to function properly, always use the following attributes with `<gcds-file-uploader>`:

- `name`
- `label`
- `uploader-id`

{% include "partials/error-message.njk" %}

### Upload multiple files

Allow the selection of more than one file using the `multiple` attribute.

### Validate file types for upload

Define the file types the file uploader accepts using the `accept` attribute.

{% include "partials/getcode.njk" %}
