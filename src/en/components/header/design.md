## Header anatomy

### Recommended elements:

**The GC header** spans the top of the site and contains the Government of Canada branded signature and the divider bar. When the site language is set using the language attribute, the signature will reflect the Official Language of the page.

**The language toggle** component is a switch for French and English content. When the site language is set using the language attribute, the toggle will be available in the other Official Language.

**The skip to content button** lets a person bypass a cluster of navigation links and jump to the main page content. It may be visible or hidden.

### Optional elements:

**The top bar** holds the site navigation, sometimes called the site menu. For transactional products or sites, like those with forms, flows, processes, or storefronts, it's optional to use a simplified or custom site menu or even no menu. Give visitors a sense of the website's purpose and priorities, Serves as a simplified site map.

**The phase banner**, when used, precedes the brand header. It's an optional element, to communicate the status of the site or page, for sites that are experimental, those in research, pilots, or products in trial mode.

**The search element** supports including a search that is local or global.

**The breadcrumb** lays a path from each level of the site's hierarchy to the current page, stated in the page title. The breadcrumb tells a person where they've been and lets them retrace their steps or jump between levels.

**The page title** tells readers what the page or site is about and acts a signpost, giving them a sense of place.

## Accessibility and design for headers

### Assemble your product's header

- Include the GC brand header and language toggle for Government of Canada sites and products.
- Always maintain the integrity of the signature. Absolutely avoid modifying the signature in any way. In particular avoid stretching or changing the colours or text.
- Add a skip to content button to aid navigation for people using assistive devices.
- Consider using the top bar bar for a simplified navigation alternative for a transactional product, like an app, a form, or a storefront.
- Include the phase banner if your page or site is experimental. For example, if it's a pilot, you're using it for research purposes, or it's in trial mode.

### Improve the accessibility of the header

- Consider making the skip to content button visible so any person navigating the site can benefit from the shortcut.
- Avoid using jargon in the phase banner, like alpha and beta. Instead opt for specific terms in plain language that describe the site's status, like "This is a trial site, being used only for research purposes at this time."
- Write header content in sentence case.

### Write specific link text

- Make link text clear and specific to help a person decide if they should leave the current page. Spell out where a person will go or what they'll find when they select a link.
- Keep link text short and distinctive so a person can scan the links in the header and find what they're looking for. Avoid using "click here" or "read more" as link text.
- Limit the number of links in your header. Too much information and increases cognitive load and can be overwhelming to some readers.

### Give your page a title

- Give the page a title that tells readers what the page (or for the landing page the site) is about, what it is for, or what to do.
- Choose either to match the page name you'll display in the browser, to be similar but slightly longer, or to use a call to action â€“ on pages for user tasks or actions.
- Write the page title in title case. All other header elements (other than proper names) are in sentence case.
