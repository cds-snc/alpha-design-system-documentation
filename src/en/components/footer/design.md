## Design and accessibility for footers

### Assemble your product's footer

- Include the footer links band for Government of Canada sites and products.
- Always maintain the integrity of the Government of Canada wordmark. Absolutely avoid modifying the wordmark in any way. In particular avoid stretching or changing the colours or text.
- Consider using the contextual band with up to three site-specific links for a transactional product, like an app, a form, or a storefront.
- Opt to include the main band for pages on Canada.ca

### Write specific link text

- Make link text clear and specific to help a person decide if they should leave the current page. Spell out where a person will go or what they'll find when they select a link.
- Keep link text short and distinctive so a person can scan the links in the footer and find what they're looking for. Avoid using "click here" or "read more" as link text.
- Limit the number of links in your footer. Too much information increases cognitive load and can be overwhelming to some readers.
