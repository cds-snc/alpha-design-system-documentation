## Language toggle anatomy

The language toggle provides a link to the page in the other Official Language.

<img class="b-sm b-default p-400" src="/images/en/components/anatomy/gcds-lang-toggle-anatomy.svg" alt="On large screens, a “Français” link. On smaller screens, an abbreviated FR link."/>

1. Language toggle is presented in full on large screens.
2. Language toggle is abbreviated on small screens.

## Design and accessibility for the language toggle

- Place the language toggle in the top right corner of the header to be predictable and findable.
- In the language toggle link, include the opposite Official Language of the current page.
