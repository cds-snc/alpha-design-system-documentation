Take a look at what checkboxes do to see if they fit the problem youâ€™re solving for.

## {{ title }}

Use a checkbox to ask a question when you are expecting the user to select more than one option from a short list of items to:

- limit the number of answers to your question.
- let a person choose one or several answers from a contained list by checking off the right ones.
- give a person the ability to answer without writing by selecting one or multiple items from a list.
