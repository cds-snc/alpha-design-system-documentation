## Accessibility and design for checkboxes

### Make checkboxes visible and options clear

- Limit the number of options to 6-7.
- Limit text for each option to a few words or a short phrase and include hint text for more context.
- Generally, order options alphabetically. In some cases, it can be helpful for you to order them from most to least common.

### Help people understand how to use checkboxes

- Avoid assuming a person will know how to use a checkbox.
- Use the [fieldset's]({{ links.fieldset }}) hint text to include a cue for users unfamiliar with radios so they know they can only make a single selection. For example, "Select the response that best applies".
- Include fieldset's hint text to include a cue for users unfamiliar with checkboxes so they know they can make multiple selections.  For example, "Select all that apply".
- Avoid pre-selecting checkbox options. This makes it more likely that users will miss a question and submit a wrong answer.
