## Accesibility and design for checkboxes

### Make checkboxes visible and options clear

- Position checkboxes to the left of their corresponding labels. This makes them easier to find, especially with screen magnifiers.
- Limit the number of options to 6-7.
- Limit text for each option to a few words or a short phrase.
- Generally, order options alphabetically. In some cases, it can be helpful for you to order them from most to least common.

### Help people understand how to use checkboxes

- Avoid assuming a person will know how to use a checkbox.
- Include a cue for users unfamiliar with checkboxes so they know they can make multiple selections, like hint text explaining how to answer, For example, ‘Select all that apply’.
- Avoid pre-selecting checkbox options. This makes it more likely that users will miss a question and submit a wrong answer.
