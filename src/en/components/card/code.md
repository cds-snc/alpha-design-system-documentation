## Build a card

Use cards to help a person discover and scan summaries or progressive, bite-sized bits of related information.

### Group multiple cards for visual consistency

When you have more than 1 card on a page:

- Organize multiple cards within a grid component.
- Use the same card type within a section on a page. Choose the link card type or the action card type for all cards rather than mixing types.
- Try to include the same properties for each card within a section on a page. For example, if one card has an image then all cards get an image.
