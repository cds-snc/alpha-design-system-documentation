## Button anatomy

<ol class="anatomy-list">
  <li>The <strong>container</strong> gives the button its visually prominent appearance.</li>
  <li>The <strong>label</strong> states the action that will follow when someone interacts with the button. Label text is left aligned, with any icon at the right-most point. Text is in sentence case (only the initial letter is capitalized).</li>
  <li>The <strong>icon</strong> is optional and can be a helpful visual aid when used sparingly and predictably. When there's an icon, align button text to the left.  Avoid using an icon without text.</li>
</ol>

## Design and accessibility for buttons

### Make the button findable

- Place buttons in a regular and predictable way.
- Avoid making a person needlessly scroll, tab, or type by providing the path to the next action early.
- Check the button border's visibility against the surface where you're placing it.
- Limit the number of buttons on a page. Reserve buttons for the most important actions.

### Write short, specific, and descriptive button labels

- Keep label text visible by stating the button's specific action in minimal words, using sentence case.
- Make the button's action obvious with a short, specific label in a call to action format, like "Start application" or "Save a copy".
- Avoid re-using label text on the same page or using labels that sound a lot alike. A person using assistive technology will hear the label text repeated in rapid succession without cues to tell which button's for which action.
- Stay away from verb phrases or expressions that may be unfamiliar to non-fluent speakers.
