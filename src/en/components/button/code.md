## Build a button

Use a button for important actions a person using a product can initiate.

## Coding and accessibility for buttons

### Make your buttons accessible

- Check the button border's visibility against the surface where you're placing it.
- Make the button's action obvious with a short, specific label in a call to action format, like "Start application" or "Save a copy".
- Avoid re-using label text on the same page or using labels that sound a lot alike. A person browsing buttons with assistive technology will hear the label text repeated in rapid succession without cues to tell which button's for which action.
