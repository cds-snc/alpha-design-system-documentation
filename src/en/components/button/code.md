## Build a button

Use a button for important actions a person using a product can initiate.

## Accessibility and coding for buttons

### Make your buttons accessible

- Check the button border's visibility against the surface where you're placing it.
- Make the button's action obvious with a short, specific label in a call to action format, like "Start application" or "Save a copy".
- Avoid re-using label text on the same page or using labels that sound a lot alike. A person browsing buttons with assistive technology will hear the label text repeated in rapid succession without cues to tell which button's for which action.

### Add a skip-to-content button

- A skip-to-content button lets a person skip a cluster of navigation links and jump to the main content.
- To avoid covering up content, configure the button to push down content so it's not floating, For desktop, place skip-to-content button at top left of the page so it doesn't interrupt the flow.

## Get your code

Generate code for a component instance by choosing properties in the values column, based on the code elements in the properties table.

Select "Get code" once you have the properties you need. That will generate code for the instance you're building.

Pull that code into your environment and you'll have a component with all the code values you chose.
