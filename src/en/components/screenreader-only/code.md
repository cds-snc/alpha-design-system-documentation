## Build a screenreader-only

Use screenreader-only for assistive technology-specific text content that communicates information solely available by visual means.

## Coding and Accessibility for screenreader-only

### Write helpful screenreader-only content

- Flag contextual information exclusively communicated through visual styling that's absent from â€Œsemantic HTML.
- Keep screenreader-only content clear and very brief. Adding too much text unnecessarily increases the cognitive load.
- Provide additional text content for assistive technologies only when the interface design relies on visual information to communicate.
- Avoid including additional information that's unavailable in the interface.
- Avoid duplicating any information included in descriptive text (alt-text). If the descriptive text already provides the context, the screenreader-only component may not be needed.

### Provide an equitable experience in both Official Languages

- Use the screenreader-only content to make sure the text will be read in the language associated with the component's language tag.
- Avoid using an `aria-label` attribute to set another language because some assistive technologies will default to page's source language.
