## Design and accessibility for the screenreader-only component

### Write helpful screenreader-only content

- Flag contextual information exclusively communicated through visual styling that’s absent from ‌semantic HTML.
- Keep screenreader-only content clear and very brief. Adding too much text unnecessarily increases the cognitive load.
- Provide additional text content specifically for assistive technologies only when the interface design relies on visual information to communicate.
- Avoid including additional information that’s unavailable in the interface.
- Avoid duplicating any information included in descriptive text (alt-text). If the descriptive text already provides the context, the screenreader-only component may not be needed.
