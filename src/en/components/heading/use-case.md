## Problems headings solves

Headings help structure content into a hierarchy for a visitor.

Use headings to:

- Aid both sighted and non-sighted people to navigate page content with a clear and organized hierarchy.
- Allow assistive technologies to scan heading levels that signal or summarize the content they contain. A person can then choose what they want to read without reviewing the entire page.
- Introduce a page or emphasize key sections or topics, making it easier for a person to scan and locate relevant information.
- Divide lengthy content into manageable sections. Breaking up your content supports readability, simplifies site navigation, and reduces the risk of people abandoning their task.
- Apply consistent typography styles and sizes throughout a website to create a cohesive and user-friendly design.
