Take a look at what text areas do to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems text areas solve

Use a text area to collect multi-line information when you're expecting a person will write:

- An individual or unique response.
- To provide space for a long, freeform response.

Note: Only collect information you're authorized to handle and be sure to safeguard it to Government of Canada standards.
