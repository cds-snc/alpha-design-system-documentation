  <li>The <strong>nav group name</strong> identifies the nav group and acts as a button to expand and collapse the nav group.</li>
  <li>The <strong>active indicator</strong> gives visual prominence to the current page.</li>

## Design and accessibility for side navigation

### Set the site name

- The site name can be a shorter version of the full name.
- For logos, include descriptive text.

Note: On mobile, the site name does not link to the homepage.

### Choose meaningful nav link text

- Make link text clear and specific to help a person decide if they should leave the current page. Spell out where a person will go or what they’ll find when they select a link.
- Keep link text short and distinctive so a person can scan the links and find what they’re looking for.
- If using breadcrumbs, align the content hierarchy in both sets of links, so each component reflects a similar path through the site.  

Tip: Read nav link text aloud in sequence to note similarities in how link text sounds when read by an assistive device.

### Add navigation groups to the side navigation

- Opt to include a second or third level with a navigaßtion group to the side navigation.
- Use a hierarchical structure of up to 3 levels to categorize and order nav group items in a logical manner.
- Nest items into categories consistent with the product’s information architecture.

### Organize nav group items alphabetically

Improve findability in nav groups with 7 or more nav links by ordering the links alphabetically – or numerically for items represented by numbers.
