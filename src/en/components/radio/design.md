## Accessibility and design for radios

### Make radios visible and options clear

- Limit the number of options to 6-7.
- Limit text for each option to a few words or a short phrase and include hint text for more context.
- Generally, order options alphabetically. In some cases, it can be helpful for you to order them from most to least common.
- When possible, include an option like "None" or "None of the above". With radios, a selected option cannot be de-selected, or reversed, except by choosing another option within the group. When no options in a group, the respondent is forced to choose an incorrect response or abandon the task.

### Help a person understand how to use radios

- Avoid assuming a person will know how to use a radio.
- Use the fieldsetâ€™s hint text to include a cue for users unfamiliar with radios so they know they can only make a single selection. For example, 'Select the response that best applies'.
- Avoid pre-selecting a radio option. This makes it more likely that users will miss a question and submit a wrong answer.
