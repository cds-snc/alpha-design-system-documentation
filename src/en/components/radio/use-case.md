Take a look at what problems radios solve to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems radios solve

Use radios with a [fieldset]({{ links.fieldset }}) to make a request for info with a set of options when you're expecting the user to only select one option to:

- Limit the number of possible answers to your question.
- Specify the possible answers to your question.
- Give a person the ability to answer without writing by selecting one item from a list.

<article class="bg-full-width bg-primary text-light pt-500 pb-400 my-500">
  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-400">Related components</h2>

<a href="{{ links.checkbox }}" class="link-light">Checkboxes</a> when you are expecting the user to select multiple options from a list of items.

<a href="{{ links.select }}" class="link-light">Select</a> when you can give someone a medium to large set of options for a known single selection.
