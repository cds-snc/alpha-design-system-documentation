Take a look at what problems radios solve to see if they fit the problem you're solving for.

## Problems radios solve

Use radios with a [fieldset](/en/components/fieldset) to make a request for info with a set of options when you're expecting the user to only select one option to:

- Limit the number of possible answers to your question.
- Specify the possible answers to your question.
- Give a person the ability to answer without writing by selecting one item from a list.

<article class="bg-full-width bg-dark text-light py-500 my-500">
  <h2 class="mt-0 mb-400">Related components</h2>

  <a href="/en/components/checkbox" class="link-light">Checkboxes</a> when you are expecting the user to select multiple options from a list of items.

  Select when you can give someone a medium to large set of options for a known single selection.
