# Foundations

The GC Design System uses design tokens for basic elements like colour, typography, and spacing.

Our design tokens are coded to store design decisions for Canada.ca, so they meet Government of Canada requirements.

You can choose from our tokens to style components and patterns without having to write hard-coded values (like specific hex colours, rem, or pixel counts).

Tokens give you an exact match to a visual style. Any changes or corrections can be made at source and propagated across all products or platforms using that token.
