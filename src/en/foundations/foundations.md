Design tokens make up the foundations of GC Design System.

Our tokens capture brand and design decisions in code for basic style elements like colours, typography, and spacing.

## Design tokens support consistency and communication

We're using design tokens to:

- **Create a consistent visual experience** by scaling design and brand decisions across components.
- **Communicate meaning consistently** to establish a predictable and trustworthy experience for the people using your services.
- **Improve communication between design and development** by defining each style decision with a name and visual representation.
