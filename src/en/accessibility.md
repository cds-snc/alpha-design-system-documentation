# Accessibility in the GC Design System

## Our accessibility standards

The GC Design System meets or exceeds Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA, making it fully compliant with <gcds-link href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601"> Government of Canada standards</gcds-link>. 

Public servants who use the components as intended and follow the guidance are creating Government of Canada websites and applications that meet or surpass accessibility standards.

## Our accessibility checklist

The entire GC Design System builds in accessibility from the start to meet the <gcds-link href="https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601">Government of Canada’s accessibility standards</gcds-link>. 

### Navigation

<gcds-details details-title="Focus states">
  Interactive elements, like buttons, links, and form fields, have clear and visible focus states to guide people who use keyboard navigation.

<gcds-details details-title="Screen magnifier compatibility">
  Screen magnifiers can be used by people with low vision to zoom in on content without losing functionality.
</gcds-details>

  Images and non-text content include appropriate alt text to provide a description for people relying on screen readers.
</gcds-details>

<gcds-details details-title="ARIA roles and attributes">

  Form fields follow guidance to have accessible labels, clear instructions, and are compatible with assistive technologies.
</gcds-details>

<gcds-details details-title="Clear and specific error messages">
  Clear and actionable guidance appears when there are errors in forms or interactions so people know how to fix the error.
</gcds-details>

## How we test for accessibility

<gcds-details details-title="Automated accessibility testing">
  Before components are released, we leverage automated tools that scan tokens, components, and website for accessibility issues. This early-stage testing allows us to resolve common issues before deeper testing begins.
</gcds-details>

<gcds-details details-title="Usability testing for accessibility needs">
  We conduct testing with people who have accessibility needs, including individuals with various disabilities. This ensures our system is functional and usable in a range of scenarios that automated testing cannot fully capture.
</gcds-details>

<gcds-details details-title="Market research and best practices">
  We’re always looking at new accessibility rules and best practices from different industries. We add new findings and suggestions to our design system.
</gcds-details>
