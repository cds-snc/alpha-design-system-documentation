## Enabling thoughtful design in small teams

This system brings together federal policy, inclusive design best practice, and reusable code in one place to enable thoughtful, accessible, well-designed services in small and large teams alike.

We’re a team of people from the Canadian Digital Service, the Digital Transformation Office, and the central Office of the Chief Information Officer, with advisors from Principal Publisher.

We want to work with you, federal public servants on web and digital product teams, to deliver human-centred services to people in Canada. [Get in touch]({{ "/en/contact" | url }}) to start a conversation about your needs.

## Ship modern products faster with less work

Spend less time doing repetitive work and more time shipping a product that meets the needs of people using your service.

## An accessible, seamless Canada.ca

Build accessible and predictable products your clients can trust. They'll know they're in the right place and can easily get the help they need.
